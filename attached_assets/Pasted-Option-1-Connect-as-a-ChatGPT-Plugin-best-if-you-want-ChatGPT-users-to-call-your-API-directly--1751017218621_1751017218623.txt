Option 1: Connect as a ChatGPT Plugin (best if you want ChatGPT users to call your API directly)
üîß Step-by-Step:

    Build or expose your API
    Ensure your Gravity Flow Labs API is accessible over HTTPS and returns clean JSON responses.

    Write an OpenAPI spec (Swagger)
    Create a YAML or JSON definition of your API endpoints. For example:

/scan:
  post:
    summary: Scan data for bias, PII, and documentation gaps
    requestBody:
      content:
        application/json:
          schema:
            $ref: '#/components/schemas/DataInput'
    responses:
      200:
        description: Scan Results

Add a Plugin Manifest file
/.well-known/ai-plugin.json (host this at your domain root)

    {
      "schema_version": "v1",
      "name_for_model": "gravity_flow_labs",
      "name_for_human": "Gravity Flow Labs",
      "description_for_model": "Scan and validate clinical/AI data for bias, privacy, and compliance.",
      "auth": {
        "type": "none"
      },
      "api": {
        "type": "openapi",
        "url": "https://yourdomain.com/openapi.yaml"
      },
      "logo_url": "https://yourdomain.com/logo.png",
      "contact_email": "support@gravityflowlabs.com",
      "legal_info_url": "https://yourdomain.com/legal"
    }

    Host your API + Spec + Manifest
    Use Vercel, Render, AWS, or your preferred host ‚Äî must be HTTPS-accessible.

    Install plugin in ChatGPT
    In ChatGPT Pro with plugins enabled:

        Click "Plugins" ‚Üí "Plugin Store" ‚Üí "Develop your own plugin"

        Enter your domain

        ChatGPT reads the manifest and auto-installs the plugin

üß† Example Use Case (how it works from ChatGPT):

User says:

    ‚ÄúScan this clinical document for compliance and bias.‚Äù

ChatGPT sends the document to your API endpoint like:

POST https://gravityflowlabs.com/scan
{
  "document": "patient report text here..."
}

Your API returns:

{
  "privacy_issues": ["Name", "MRN"],
  "bias_flags": ["gender skew"],
  "compliance_score": 86,
  "recommendation": "Mask identifiers, add missing consent form"
}

ChatGPT summarizes this intelligently for the user.
